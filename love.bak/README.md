# A simple css3 animation page

This page shows a poetry with css3 animation & jQuery.

Enter 'xxx' in the input DOM and press Enter to start.

Use 'webkitAnimationEnd' event to control animation flow, may invalid on non-webkit browsers.

Wrote for ex and she abandoned me, but I have found a girl who really loves me now. :)
